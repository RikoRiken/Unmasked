## Description

Unmasked is a lightweight and beginner-friendly web tool designed to reveal what modern browsers silently expose about users.

Its goal is to help identify how unique and traceable a device can be based on client-side information like screen size, system language, browser details, and advanced fingerprinting techniques — all without using cookies or active tracking.

Originally created as a learning project to explore JavaScript, browser APIs, and privacy concepts, Unmasked now serves as a useful base for anyone who wants to:

- Understand how digital fingerprinting works in real-world browsers
- Raise awareness about passive data leaks and tracking
- Practice building full-stack privacy tools using JavaScript and Python
