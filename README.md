## Description

Unmasked is a lightweight and beginner-friendly web tool designed to reveal what modern browsers silently expose about users.

Its goal is to help identify how unique and traceable a device can be based on client-side information like screen size, system language, browser details, and advanced fingerprinting techniques ‚Äî all without using cookies or active tracking.

Originally created as a learning project to explore JavaScript, browser APIs, and privacy concepts, Unmasked now serves as a useful base for anyone who wants to:

- Understand how digital fingerprinting works in real-world browsers
- Raise awareness about passive data leaks and tracking
- Practice building full-stack privacy tools using JavaScript and Python

<br>

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Uniqueness Score

- ‚úÖ Calculates a score from 0 to 100 based on the uniqueness of your configuration
- ‚úÖ Breakdown of each factor contributing to the score
<br>

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Detailed Insight

A clear information for each data point is given (you can check the About page to have more informations): 
- IP Address
- Timezone
- Language
- User-Agent

## Utilisation

### üö¶ Step-by-Step Guide

<br>

**1. Go to the HomePage**

Visit the landing page of the application via  <a href="https://rikoriken.github.io/Unmasked/">rikoriken.github.io/Unmasked</a>

<br>

**2. Launch a Scan**

Click on the **‚ÄúStart Scan‚Äù** button to open the scanning page.

<br>

**3. Wait a few seconds**

The app will automatically analyze your browser and device fingerprint.
No action is required, results load instantly.

<br>

**4. Explore the details**

You can explore all the data points, and read your Uniqueness Score, a score between **0 and 100** will appear, indicating how unique your fingerprint is.
‚Üí _Lower score_ = less unique (better for privacy).
‚Üí _Higher score_ = more unique (easier to track).

<br>

**5. Run another scan**

Click **‚ÄúNew Scan‚Äù** to refresh the results and see if your fingerprint changes _(e.g., with a VPN or browser extension)_.
