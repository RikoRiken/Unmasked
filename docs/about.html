    <h2>Basic informations: explanation</h2>
    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">IP Address</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Your IP address, short for <i>Internet Protocol address</i>, is a unique number assigned to your device when it connects to the internet. It works a bit like a postal address: it tells websites and services where to send the information you request.<br> But your IP doesn‚Äôt just handle data delivery, it also reveals information about your connection:
            <ul>
                <li>Your country, region, and often your city</li>
                <li>Your internet service provider (ISP)</li>
                <li>Whether you're using a corporate network, school, or mobile data</li>
                <li>If you're using tools like a VPN or proxy server</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">Language</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Your browser language reveals how you interact with the web, and where you‚Äôre from. Most browsers send a list of preferred languages (like en-US, fr-FR, or es-419) to every website you visit. This list helps sites display content in your native language automatically.
            <br><br>But beyond convenience, it also reveals:
            <ul>
                <li>Your primary language and regional variant</li>
                <li>Your cultural or geographical background</li>
                <li>The type of keyboard or operating system you likely use</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">Timezone</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Your device‚Äôs timezone tells websites where and when you are. Every operating system is configured with a timezone, which reflects your geographical location and current time offset from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, if your timezone is ‚ÄúUTC+1‚Äù, it usually means you‚Äôre somewhere in central Europe, like France, UK...<br><br>Why does this matter?
            <ul>
                <li>It helps websites display local time correctly (e.g., for calendars or scheduled posts)</li>
                <li>It can reveal your approximate location, even without knowing your IP</li>
                <li>It contributes to your browser fingerprint, especially if it doesn‚Äôt match your other location signals (like IP or language)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">User Agent</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p> The User-Agent string is like your browser‚Äôs business card, and it's handed out to every website you visit.
                <br><br>It contains detailed information about your:
            <ul>
                <li>Browser name and version (e.g. Chrome 114.0)</li>
                <li>Operating system (e.g. Windows 10, macOS, Android)</li>
                <li>Sometimes your device type (mobile, desktop, tablet)</li>
                <li>Occasionally, the CPU architecture or rendering engine</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">Hardware Concurrency</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p> hardwareConcurrency is a JavaScript API that reveals the number of logical CPU threads your device can use in parallel. This includes physical cores and hyper-threaded virtual cores, giving a more precise insight into your system‚Äôs parallel processing power.<br><br>For example:
            <ul>
                <li>A quad-core CPU with hyper-threading may report 8 threads.</li>
                <li>A low-end phone might show only 2 or 4.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">Device memory</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p> This value reflects the amount of RAM (Random Access Memory) your device reports as available to the browser, typically measured in gigabytes (GB). It is retrieved using the navigator.deviceMemory property, which provides a rounded approximation of your system's memory.<br><br>While this figure doesn't always represent the exact amount of RAM on your machine (it's often rounded to values like 2, 4, 8, or 16 GB), it still offers enough information to help websites infer the performance level or class of your device whether it‚Äôs a low-end smartphone or a high-end desktop.
