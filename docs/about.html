    <h2>Basic informations: explanation</h2>
    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">IP Address</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Your IP address, short for <i>Internet Protocol address</i>, is a unique number assigned to your device when it connects to the internet. It works a bit like a postal address: it tells websites and services where to send the information you request.<br> But your IP doesn‚Äôt just handle data delivery, it also reveals information about your connection:
            <ul>
                <li>Your country, region, and often your city</li>
                <li>Your internet service provider (ISP)</li>
                <li>Whether you're using a corporate network, school, or mobile data</li>
                <li>If you're using tools like a VPN or proxy server</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">Language</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Your browser language reveals how you interact with the web, and where you‚Äôre from. Most browsers send a list of preferred languages (like en-US, fr-FR, or es-419) to every website you visit. This list helps sites display content in your native language automatically.
            <br><br>But beyond convenience, it also reveals:
            <ul>
                <li>Your primary language and regional variant</li>
                <li>Your cultural or geographical background</li>
                <li>The type of keyboard or operating system you likely use</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">Timezone</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p>Your device‚Äôs timezone tells websites where and when you are. Every operating system is configured with a timezone, which reflects your geographical location and current time offset from the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, if your timezone is ‚ÄúUTC+1‚Äù, it usually means you‚Äôre somewhere in central Europe, like France, UK...<br><br>Why does this matter?
            <ul>
                <li>It helps websites display local time correctly (e.g., for calendars or scheduled posts)</li>
                <li>It can reveal your approximate location, even without knowing your IP</li>
                <li>It contributes to your browser fingerprint, especially if it doesn‚Äôt match your other location signals (like IP or language)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">User Agent</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p> The User-Agent string is like your browser‚Äôs business card, and it's handed out to every website you visit.
                <br><br>It contains detailed information about your:
            <ul>
                <li>Browser name and version (e.g. Chrome 114.0)</li>
                <li>Operating system (e.g. Windows 10, macOS, Android)</li>
                <li>Sometimes your device type (mobile, desktop, tablet)</li>
                <li>Occasionally, the CPU architecture or rendering engine</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">Hardware Concurrency</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p> hardwareConcurrency is a JavaScript API that reveals the number of logical CPU threads your device can use in parallel. This includes physical cores and hyper-threaded virtual cores, giving a more precise insight into your system‚Äôs parallel processing power.<br><br>For example:
            <ul>
                <li>A quad-core CPU with hyper-threading may report 8 threads.</li>
                <li>A low-end phone might show only 2 or 4.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">Device memory</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p> This value reflects the amount of RAM (Random Access Memory) your device reports as available to the browser, typically measured in gigabytes (GB). It is retrieved using the navigator.deviceMemory property, which provides a rounded approximation of your system's memory.<br><br>While this figure doesn't always represent the exact amount of RAM on your machine (it's often rounded to values like 2, 4, 8, or 16 GB), it still offers enough information to help websites infer the performance level or class of your device whether it‚Äôs a low-end smartphone or a high-end desktop.
            </p>
        </div>

    <h2>Fingerprinting details: explanation</h2>
    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">Canvas Fingerprint</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p> The Canvas API is a powerful browser feature used to draw shapes, images, or text directly in your browser ‚Äî often for animations, charts, or visual effects. But it can also be used to generate a fingerprint of your device.<br><br>How does it work?
            <ul>
                <li>Your browser is asked to render a specific image or text on a hidden canvas element.</li>
                <li>The image is then converted into data (a long string of pixels).</li>
                <li>Even if the drawing looks identical to the human eye, tiny rendering differences emerge based on:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your operating system</li>
                        <li>Your GPU and drivers</li>
                        <li>Font rendering techniques</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
            These tiny differences are enough to generate a unique hash ‚Äî a kind of digital signature for your device.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">WebGL Vendor</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p> The WebGL Vendor reveals the graphics card manufacturer or GPU provider that your device uses to render 3D content via WebGL, a browser-based graphics API.<br><br>The WebGL Vendor, especially when combined with other values such as the WebGL Renderer or the Canvas Fingerprint, can contribute to a uniquely identifying fingerprint of your device. Here's why it matters:

            <ul>
                <li>Not all computers use the same GPU.</li>
                <li>Some machines use integrated graphics (e.g., Intel), while others use dedicated ones (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD).</li>
                <li>Apple devices often report "Apple Inc." or specific Apple GPUs.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-grid">
        <div class="label">WebGL Renderer</div>
        <div class="description">
            <p> The WebGL Renderer provides more detailed information about the specific graphics processor your device uses to render 3D content in the browser. It typically shows the GPU model and sometimes additional driver or rendering engine details.<br><br>The WebGL Renderer gives away precise hardware information that can significantly increase your uniqueness online:
            <ul>
                <li>The GPU model and rendering backend can vary widely from device to device.</li>
                <li>If you're using virtualization, emulation, or non-standard drivers, this value may be even more distinctive.</li>
                <li>Combined with the WebGL Vendor and other fingerprinting metrics, this adds to a more complete device profile.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
